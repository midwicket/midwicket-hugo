<p><em><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></em></p>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="#withdrawconsent">here</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</p>

No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 0 seconds.</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<h3 id="6-what-are-your-privacy-rights">6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>

<h3 id="7-controls-for-do-not-track-features">7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&lsquo;DNT&rsquo;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
<h3 id="8-do-california-residents-have-specific-privacy-rights">8. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>

<p>Right to be informed — Request to know</p>
<p>Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:</p>

<p>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights</p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>
<p>Verification process</p>
<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>
<p>Other privacy rights</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can designate an authorised agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorised agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorised to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.</p>
